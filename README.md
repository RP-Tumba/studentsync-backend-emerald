# **Student Management System Capstone Project**

**Project Objective:** Develop a comprehensive web application for managing student information, demonstrating full-stack development skills through a robust, user-friendly student management system. The project aims to showcase understanding in web development technologies, API design, and responsive application development.

### **Week 1: Backend Development (CRUD Operations)**

- **Day 1 - Day 4**:
    - Set up the backend environment (e.g., database, API framework).
    - Implement CRUD operations for the necessary models/entities (e.g., for students, courses, etc.).
    - Ensure proper routing and handling of API requests (e.g., POST for Create, GET for Read, PUT/PATCH for Update, DELETE for Delete).
    - Write basic validation for inputs where necessary.
- **Day 5: Retrospective**
    - Review progress on backend tasks.
    - Discuss what worked well, any challenges faced with the CRUD operations, and areas for improvement.
    - Adjust the plan for the upcoming frontend work based on feedback.
